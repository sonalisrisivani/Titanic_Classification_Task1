To make a system which tells whether the passengers survived in the Titanic shipwreck.

RMS Titanic
The RMS Titanic was a British passenger liner that sank in the North Atlantic Ocean in the early morning hours of 15 April 1912, after it collided with an iceberg during its maiden voyage from Southampton to New York City. There were an estimated 2,224 passengers and crew aboard the ship, and more than 1,500 died, making it one of the deadliest commercial peacetime maritime disasters in modern history. One of the reasons that the shipwreck led to such loss of life was that there were not enough lifeboats for the passengers and crew.
